#### Branching Strategy :

Because, this is an individual project, the strategy is simple. <br />
There are 2 main branches, master and development. <br />
The master branch is the main, production branch. <br/>
And the development branch is where the work is primarily done.<br />
If more than one feature is being developed at a time, then temporary feature <br />
branches are created for each feature. <br />
Once finished, these are merged with the development branch. <br />
After significant change(s), the development branch is merged with the master. <br/>
However, this is done only after testing that the code is stable.

#### Workflow Strategy :
Again, given that this is an individual project, a simple
[incremental build model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_build_model) <br />
should work just fine.

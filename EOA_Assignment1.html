        <h3>What RESTful APIs will be used?</h3>

        <dl>
          <dt>

              <abbr title="Global Biodiversity Information Facility">GBIF</abbr>
              REST API
            </a>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            This API is the primary source of data. It'll provide almost all
            required information about each animal species. This data will be
            used highlight critically endangered species.
          </dd>

          <dt>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/">Wikimedia REST API</a>
          </dt>

          <dd>
            This'll be used to complement the GBIF data, by providing the user
            with images, short description and other information about the species.
          </dd>

        </p>

        <h3>What are the entities and their attributes that'll be stored in
          the database?</h3>
        <ul>

        <h3>Who are the potential users of this website?</h3>

        <p>
          People who are already passionate about conservation and rewilding.
          However, more importantly, this website can be a good starting point
          anyone who isn't convinced to the scale of the problems faced today.
          So, it can act as a means for the aforementioned group to spread awareness.
        </p>

        <h3>What are the goals that this website hopes to achieve?</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            To spread awareness about the scale at which wildlife is being
            destroyed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Try to highlight humanity's role in this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
            Provide resources for people who want to help and take action.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why was this topic selected?</h3>

        <p>
          Although, at this point most people are aware of the problems that
          this planet is facing. I believe most of them are still unaware about
          how serious the issue is. I wanted to build something would make
          more people take climate change seriously.

              So, far I haven't been able to find an API, which gives animal
              population data, which was the goal. However, the APIs listed above
              do provide status (extinct, endangered, etc) and other info, which
              will suffice, if no other API is available.
